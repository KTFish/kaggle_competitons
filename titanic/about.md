<b> Titanic </b> was a British passenger liner, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912. The aim of this competiton is to predict the survival rate of passengers.

The titanic and titanic2 data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers
on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it
does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about
Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by
a variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic:
Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by
many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.

The data set is one of the most famous for students beginning to learn machine learning. So I decided to take the Titanic challange too!
